# ~/.claude

My personal [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) setup.

Version-controlled [commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/commands) and [skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) I use for Rust projects, mostly for [bearcove](https://github.com/bearcove) and [facet](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet).

## Commands

Workflow automation I can invoke explicitly:
- Rust dev stuff (check, tests, clippy, fmt)
- GitHub workflows (fix issues, create PRs, manage CI)
- Session handoffs

## Skills

Domain knowledge Claude pulls in when relevant:
- Rust tooling (compilation profiling, bloat analysis)
- Debugging (valgrind, Cranelift JIT, test instrumentation)
- GitHub operations

That's it.
